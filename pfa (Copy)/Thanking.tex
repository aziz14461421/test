With these few words, I would like to pay tribute to all the people who have contributed to the good progress of this project and its accomplishment in the best conditions.\\

This work would not have been possible without the presence of my family mom, dad and my little brother, also, my supervisor Mr. Arbi Menzli and my professors at ISI KEF who were always motivating, helpful and responsive. Their valuable advice had spared no effort to transmit to me information and put me on the right track.\\

I would also like to thank the jury for having devoted their precious time to judge this work.

In my work we started with a research about the  types of hotels websites , and then we started exploring the types of informations needed by the hotel. Afterwards, we went to the development part, where we prepared the programming language and the framework and then started the web development. \\
