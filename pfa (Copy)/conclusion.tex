This internship has been very enriching for me as it allowed me to consolidate my design skills, enrich my knowledge in JAVA, and learn Angular, which is a very comprehensive and powerful framework. This internship also offered me the opportunity to discover and work with the MySQL relational database management system.

With this experience and in response to its challenges, I would like to try adding a module where the administrator can manage complaints. In this stage, we have completed our project, but this does not imply that the work done is perfect or unchangeable. On the contrary, it will remain open to any proposals for improvement.
