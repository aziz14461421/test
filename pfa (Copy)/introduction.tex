This internship has provided a very enriching path with information and experiences for the student to employ their skills in a professional and well-supported environment. Over the course of four weeks, we have managed to achieve our goals of gathering as much information as possible and using it appropriately in the creation of our web application.

The purpose of this report is not only to provide a comprehensive presentation of all the technical aspects that we have learned or deepened, but also, in a concise and clear manner, to give an overview of the technical and human aspects that we have encountered.

In this report, we first presented an overview of the project framework, then we presented the analysis and specification of requirements, followed by the design phase, and finally, the implementation phase.
